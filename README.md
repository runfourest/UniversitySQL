# UniversitySQL

Purpose of this is to demonstrate lineage and the complexities of SQL to University Students. Included are some sample Queries, a Photo of the Moodle 3.4 LMS schema and an interactive
schema that needs to be uploaded into Mysql workbench. 


The SQL Script attached contains three(3) seperate scripts of varying complexity. To run these scripts you need a database instance of moodle 3.4 hosted by MYSQL and MYSQL workbench installed locally. Run the queries individually from there.
